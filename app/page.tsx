                        Most voting systems in use today are imperfect and often leave people feeling unsatisfied.
                        They limit you to casting a single vote, without considering your full preferences.
                        Verivote aims to educate people about alternative voting methods, offering a way to explore
                        different systems with small polls among friends. It&#39;s a simple, interactive way to learn
                        how
                        these alternative voting and counting methods work, providing a more accurate reflection of
                        group preferences.

                        Instant-Runoff Voting allows voters to rank candidates. If no candidate secures a
                        majority, the lowest-ranked candidate is eliminated, and their votes are
                        redistributed to the next preference until a candidate wins by majority.

                        In Positional Voting, voters rank candidates, and each position on the ballot is assigned a
                        specific point value. Candidates earn points based on their ranking, and the candidate with the
                        highest total wins.

                        In Score Voting, voters rate each candidate on a numerical scale. The candidate with the
                        highest total score across all ballots is declared the winner.
